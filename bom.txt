Notes:
1. I make these by buying BNC cables of 2ft lenght. I just cut them in half
and strip the ends. 
2. The pcb design files are provided with the rest of the project files.
3. These parts are made out of plastic. Drawings are provided in the project
files.
4. It is also required to have an epoxy to hold the piezo bend speakers to the
pcb. Ether Devcon "5 minute" (Mcmaster-Carr # 66215A23) or the much better but 
slower curing "2 Ton" (Mcmaster-Carr # 66215A24).
5. To protect the pcb components from exposure to various threats an
electrical grade RTV is also advised such as Dow/Corning RTV 748
(Mcmaster-Carr # 74915A654).
6. Solder with a rosin core must be used here. "Washable" and "Water Soluble"
fluxes are not possible because of the use of wire which can not be
washed/cleaned with out additional corrosion.
7. Obviously all the above substances must be used in a well ventilated area.

Along with the usual tools it's good to have a 4-40 tap, tweezers 00-SA, and 
a microscope.
